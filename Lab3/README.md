## Lab 3: Working with openMP programs on cluster
### Goal
In this lab, you will learn about programming and performance of OpenMP programs running on shared memory MIMD.  Furthermore, you will compare the difference of algorithm design, implementation, and resulting performance obtained due to the choice of algorithms, languages, constructs used, data layout, and order of operations in parallel implementations.

### Gaussian Elimination
In linear algebra, Gaussian Elimination is an algorithm for solving systems of linear equations, finding the rank of a matrix, and calculating the inverse of an invertible square matrix. For example, given matrix A (4x4), the Gaussian Elimination converts matrix A into an upper triangle matrix A(4)
